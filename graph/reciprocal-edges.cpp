/*
 * Given a list of directed graph edges, return the number of reciprocal edges. A reciprocal edge is a reverse edge,
 * e.g. A->B is a reciproval edge to B->A and vice versa.
Example:
Input: [ [A,B], [A,C], [B,C], [C,A] ]
Output: 1
Explanation: C->A is a reciprocal edge to A->C, or A->C is a reciprocal edge to C->A, so the answer is 1.
